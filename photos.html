            <span id="artist-statement">My work aims to communicate the beauty of the world no matter where you are looking at it from. <br>I chose to take a photography class to further accomplish that vision. <br>The biggest similarities in my work exist in the vibrancy and contrast of every image. <br>I believe that a colorful image serves to further my goal because <br>bright colors draw attention, which is critical to my goal.<br>Although I shoot anything, portraits are my favorite because<br>I believe that a person's face can tell a better story than any still object ever could.<br>My favorite artist to emulate is Yousuf Karsh because of the bright whites and deep blacks in his work,<br>which bring to light a big story. From my photos I want others to see the<br>world for how beautiful it can truly be and that even the gloomiest of photos can have light.</span>
